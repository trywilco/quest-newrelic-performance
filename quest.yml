title: Performance
description: "The only systems that don’t have any bugs in production are the ones that don’t have any users. Lucky enough we have users that are using our products, but no matter how much we’ll try, users will encounter some problems while using our product. All we have is to pray it won’t happen on weekends, and try very hard to detect and mitigate this as soon as possible, with minimal effects to as few users as possible. In this quest we’ll practice fixing an urgent error in production and the cycle of mitigating it: detect, reproduce, get into the root cause and upload a fix."
summary: "Wow, what a ride, huh?\nToday we tackled one of the hardest issues an engineer can encounter: an urgent performance issue live in production. \nIt usually starts with some kind of bottleneck that becomes apparent during a rare edge case, such as an ad going viral. This is when we begin to see that some pieces of code are just not optimized enough for a spike in traffic, clogging the whole system and affecting the users.\n\nThe first order of business is detecting where exactly this happens. This is why it’s so important to have monitoring systems in place. Then, before attempting to fix the problem, we have to establish some kind of benchmark to understand how “slow” the problematic operation is— because only that way we’ll be sure that we’ve fixed the issue when we deploy a fix. After the benchmarking is done, we can push code and verify that the system is now faster and able to handle the load."
